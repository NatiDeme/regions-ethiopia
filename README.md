### Prerequisites

In order to run this project, you need:

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NatiDeme/regions-ethiopia.git

Create a .env file in the project root directory. This file will store sensitive or configuration-specific information like API keys and tokens. In this case, you'll need a Mapbox access token.

```sh
 touch .env
```

Obtain a Mapbox Access Token
To use Mapbox maps, you need an access token. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Visit the Mapbox website.
2. Sign in to your Mapbox account or create a new one.
3. Once logged in, navigate to your Mapbox account dashboard.
4. Click on the "Create token" button to generate a new access token.
5. Give your token a name and set the appropriate permissions (usually "styles:read" and "tiles:read").
6. Click "Create token" to generate it.
7. Copy the generated token.

Add the Mapbox Access Token to the .env File
Open the .env file you created earlier in a text editor and add your Mapbox access token as follows:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE with the actual access token you obtained from Mapbox.
