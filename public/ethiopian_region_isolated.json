        "description":"The Mereb Gash Basin is a sedimentary basin located in eastern Africa, straddling the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is part of the larger East African Rift System and covers an area of approximately 70,000 square kilometers. The basin is characterized by a series of fault-bounded blocks that have been uplifted and tilted, resulting in a complex geological structure. The Mereb Gash Basin is known to contain significant reserves of oil and gas, as well as other mineral resources such as gold, copper, and potash. Oil exploration in the basin began in the 1960s, and several international oil companies have conducted exploration activities in the area over the years. However, commercial production of oil and gas has not yet been achieved in the basin due to various factors, including political instability, security concerns, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the potential of the Mereb Gash Basin as an important hydrocarbon province continues to attract the attention of international oil companies and investors. The Eritrean and Ethiopian governments have recently announced plans to further develop the region's oil and gas sector, which includes increasing exploration activities in the Mereb Gash Basin. If successful, the development of the basin's oil and gas resources could have a significant impact on the local economy and help to meet the growing energy needs of the region. Additionally, the basin is home to several important wildlife species, and the development of ecotourism in the area could provide an additional source of income for local communities.",

The basin structure runs roughly parallel to the Red Sea, extending into Djibouti and Eritrea as well. This desert area is characterised by a flat surface interrupted by only a few hills known as Mount Dallol, Black Mountain and Ashe Ale. The Denakil River Basin has an area of 74,002 km2 , which covers Tigray, Amhara and Afar Regional States. The lowest elevation in the basin is -197 m at Denakil Depression, which is also the lowest altitude in the country; however, the highest elevation is 3,962 m near Ashe Ale peak. The Denakil River basin has no major river draining out of it; however water flows from small-scale irrigation wells along with larger rivers such as Omo river (703 km long) and Haud). Around 12 small-scale 29 medium-scale 8 large-scale and 54 irrigation potential sites are identified in the basin. A total 158776 hectares of potential irrigable area is also estimated. The Danakil Basin is located in the northeastern part of southern Ethiopia. It is one of the hottest places on Earth, with daytime temperatures reaching up to 50Â°C and in winter they are consistently in the high thirties. It is also one of the lowest places on the planet since much of the Danakil Basin lies below current sea level. Precipitation in the basin itself is rare and there are no permanent settlements within the region due to its extreme conditions and salt at surface. These climatic conditions (hot and very little rain) are conducive for low-cost solar evaporation. Water in the region is mostly subterranean and comes from adjacent lush catchment zones of Ethiopian Highlands",

The Blue Nile (Abbay) river begins in Lake Tana and flows about 1,450 kilometers before merging with the White Nile to form the Nile proper. The river basin has a maximum elevation of 4261 meters and a minimum elevation of 500 meters. The river basin's total mean annual flow is estimated to be 54.8 BMC. The Abbay river basin, a land of stunning gorges and mountains, is well known as the Nile's source. Abbay is Ethiopia's most important river basin. It accounts for 20% of Ethiopia's land area, over 50% of total average annual runoff from the Ethiopian highlands, 25% of its population, and more than 40% of its agricultural productivity. The rivers of the Abbay basin provide around 62 percent of the Nile at Aswan on average; when combined with the contributions of the Baro Akobo and Tekeze rivers, Ethiopia contributes for at least 86 percent of the runoff at Aswan. The Abbay river basin has a potential for 211 irrigation projects, with 90 being small-scale, 69 being medium-scale, and 52 being large-scale. A total of 815,581 hectares of potential irrigable land is projected, of which 45,856 ha are for small-scale development, 130,395 ha for medium-scale development, and 639,330 ha for large-scale development.",

The first ever study of this basin was carried out between 1961 and 1965. It covers a total area of 110,000sq.km of which 64,000sq.km, comprising the western catchment, drains to the River Awash and its tributaries. The remaining 46,000sq.km, comprises the so-called Eastern Catchment which drains into the desert area and does not contribute to the main river course. The river rises at an elevation of about 3,000m in the Central Ethiopian Highlands, west of Addis Ababa and then flows generally north eastwards along the rift valley into the Afar Triangle where it terminates in Lake Abe at an elevation of 250m. The main river length is about 1,200km. Once the project had been commenced, it was a basin-wide project, which saw an increase in the socio-economical and quality of life not only all around the basin,  but also created a large market network for the commercial agricultural goods that were being grown in the Awash Area.",

In terms of geographical area, 53% of the Basin lies in Oromiya Region and 45% is located in Somali Region. The share of SNNP is very small at only 2%. Seven administrative zones are partly or completely located within the Basin: Bale, Guji and Borena Zones in Oromiya Region, Sidama and Gedeo Zones in SNNPR; Afder and Liben Zones in Somali Region.The Basin is divided into four major landforms, namely highlands and plateau surrounded by a range of volcanoes, steep sloping escarpments, gently sloping lowlands adjacent to the foot of these escarpments, and lowlands and flood plain basins. Genale-Dawa River Basin contains a number of different climatic zones, including hot arid climate in the south-eastern region along Somalia's border with the Wabe-Shebele Basin; hot semi-arid in the lower central zone of the basin and south west area; tropical rainy climate in extreme south and higher central basin areas; warm temperate climate in mid western area and boundary divide; warm temperate rainy climate in Sidamo mountains and intermediate zone south of Bale mountains; cool highland climate at highest elevations in Bale mountains. The main drainage system is defined by three principal rivers: Genale, Dawa and Weyb, and their respective sub-catchments. Tributaries of the centrally located Genale River originate form the southern flanks of the Bale Mountains, and from the Sidamo Mountains in the north-west. The Dawa River headwaters are located in the Sidamo Mountains, while the Weyb River originates from the northern flanks of the Bale Mountains. A short distance upstream of the confluence of Genale and Dawa rivers, the Weyb converges with Genale near to the Somalia border at Dolo Odo.  After this point, the combined watercourse becomes the Juba river which flows through Somalia to the Indian Ocean. ",

More than 70% of the catchment (202,220 km2) is lying in Ethiopia. The air temperature of the Wabi Shebele Basin varies with altitude. The mean monthly temperature of the basin is 19.9ËC. The climate of the basin is dependent on the altitude and strong latitudinal movement of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The highlands are cool and densely populated while the lowlands are arid and sparsely populated with recorded annual rainfall of 1213 mm and 268 mm respectively. The basin is divided into four geographical areas based on morphometric characteristics and rainfall regimes: upper catchments which characterized by a mountainous area with abrupt valleys; middle catchments which is wider highland and rainy area; eastern catchments which characterized semi-arid areas and lower catchments which covers arid lowland area of the basin. The watershed characteristics analysis using Arc GIS indicate that flood characteristics of Wabi Shebele Basin is related to basin and relief morphometric characteristics. The mean peak flow (QMPF) in Wabi Shebele Basin has large positive association with linear morphometric parameters (like valley length, mean stream length) and with basin morphometric parameter (like drainage size, shape factor) and negative associations with relief morphometric characteristics (like basin elevation and valley slope).
